# Scala Learning Guide

Welcome to your Scala learning notes. These documentation files have been significantly enriched with explicit, beginner-friendly line-by-line breakdowns of all code snippets. If you have absolutely zero prior Scala experience, these breakdowns will explain exactly what every keyword, type, and symbol does in plain English.
